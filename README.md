## Hydration

- client:load -> loads immediately
- client:idle -> wait until browser is chilling
- client:visible -> wait until component is visible to viewport

## Limitation

no possible to do client side routing
does not work like single page application

## Responsive Design

## v.4.6.2
### image processing 
import and use Astro's built in <Image /> component for optimized images in webp and svg using astro:assets 

``` js
---
// import the Image component and the image
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import myImage from '../assets/my_image.png'; // Image is 1600x900
---

<!-- `alt` is mandatory on the Image component -->
<Image src={myImage} alt="A description of my image." />
