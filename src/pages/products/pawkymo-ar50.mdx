The **Pawkymo AR50 2X2** pushes electric bike engineering to a new frontier—combining dual motors, dual batteries, and serious suspension into a single, off-road-ready machine. Designed for riders who demand total terrain control and rugged utility, the AR50 offers raw power and intelligent flexibility.

At the heart of the AR50 is a **dual-motor, all-wheel-drive system**, giving you the ability to switch between front, rear, or full dual-motor drive modes on the fly. Paired with **twin 1000W BAFANG motors** and **2400Wh of LG battery power**, this system delivers explosive acceleration, confident hill climbing, and sustained performance—even on throttle-only rides.

The bike’s **dual FOC vector controllers** ensure smooth, efficient power delivery, while each battery pack includes its own **12-point battery management system (BMS)** for added safety and long-term reliability.

The AR50’s design is built for utility and adventure. With **30+ external mounting points**, it’s a fully modular platform, perfect for cargo racks, trail kits, or off-grid accessories. **Motorcycle-grade hydraulic disc brakes**, **front and rear suspension with KKE adjustable shocks**, and **puncture-resistant fat tires** ensure you stay in control no matter the terrain.

A **4.6” TFT Smart Display** adds an intelligent edge, featuring Bluetooth, ride tracking, navigation, OTA updates, and more—all accessible via your smartphone through the official app.

From high-speed trail rides to gear-heavy expeditions, the AR50 is more than just an eBike—it’s a full-powered, all-terrain vehicle built to explore without limits.
